<h3>VISUALIZATION IN MY MIND</h3>
<div class="img">

<p class="visual">

	In my visualization board i can say that in the book "born a crime" , there is racism and dicrimination in which is still happening in our lives today.Women dont get a chance to say their views and opinions regarding any matters in our life today.Women today tend to stand on their own even if they are stepped on by the men.Women have now become leaders and are leading men in political parties.Some struggle without the help of men unlike in the past women used to suffer after being chased out by their men.They embrace their struggles and difficulties in order to overcome them and become better women in their life.In Offices also women lack good jobs due to gender inequality in which is not fair at all but women today they have enough skills to be hired in those jobs.
	Gender violence is also a key factor in today lives of women,like andrews dad used to beat trevors mum without him being arrested and the time he was arrested he was released after which shows there is insecurity in womens lives there is no one to defend them.Women today know how to fight for their rights and also rights for their children when they are abused.There is also racial segregation in which the systemic separation of people into racial or other ethnic groups in daily life.This is seen in workplaces,gatherings,political parties and also in congregation activities.Everybody has a right and equal opportunities to everything but people tend to ignore the fact.
	People are also hurtless as we saw in the book trevor Noah as unarmed person is being shot by a police officer without any reason as it also happens in our lives today this people should be punished and not be left to walk freely in the world.Also in mans search for meaning we can see the writer is suffering in different scenarios but still he had the hope for seeing his family back at home as he used to write a script about his wife.These scenarios made him to become stronger everyday as he was a slave.Trevors tough ubringing by the mum made him to become a better person in life as he learns from the experiences of her  mum.

<p class="colonisation">
	Buju Banton in a recent interview with the Breakfast Club shared that “ when you rent a house you cannot change the structure to fit your needs. Meaning you are forced to work with the structure and if you don’t want, you leave.
	One effect of colonisation is education which was a major effect.People become enlightened about schooling which later helped helped them gain enough skills to be hired in jobs and earn their living.People also gain skills to make machines to ease their work.A recent study by UNESCO revealed that the poverty rate around the world could decrease by half if all adults complete their secondary education. Education helps reduce inequalities and achieve gender equality. It also empowers people everywhere to live more healthy and sustainable lives.It also creates better communications and promotes dialogues between various peoples of the world. Education helps find ways and means to create newer things that help improve quality of our lives.Also introduction of technology and medicine which impacted people lives as before they where using herbal drugs.Introduction of new medicine helped africans as these drugs took immediate effects after taking them.Introduction of technology as it eases means of communication in different parts of the world.It improved peoples lives as everything improved with new trends in technology.
       Negative effects of colonisation include introduction of foreign diseases to livestock and humans and some of these disease were incurable which made people to experience pain and suffering.Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life. Death due to disease is called death by natural causes.Some of these diseases were infectious and could not be controlled which led to more sufferings.It also brought ethnic rivalries between different ethnic groups.Unequal treatment of citizens on the basis of ethnicity is a common factor  of the state by large numbers of frustrated and politically conscious people, political development, and rather created fertile ground for conflict  in many African countries and has a negative effect on economic and social development.Rather it also brought western culture as more people tend to inherit the western culture including their lifestyle,mode of dressing,food and standards of living which made people to lose their own culture.
